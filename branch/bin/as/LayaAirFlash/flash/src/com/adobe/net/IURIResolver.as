	 * The URI class cannot know about DNS aliases, virtual hosts, or

	 * an implementation of this interface to resolve the URI before the
	 * URI class makes any comparisons.  For example, a web host has
	 * two aliases:
	 * 
	 * <p><code>
	 *    http://www.site.com/
	 *    http://www.site.net/
	 * </code></p>

	 * <p>The application can provide an implementation that automatically
	 * resolves site.net to site.com before URI compares two URI objects.
	 * Only the application can know and understand the context in which
	 * the URI's are being used.</p>
	 * 
	 * <p>Use the URI.resolver accessor to assign a custom resolver to
	 * the URI class.  Any resolver specified is global to all instances
	 * of URI.</p>
	 * 
	 * <p>URI will call this before performing URI comparisons in the
	 * URI.getRelation() and URI.getCommonParent() functions.</p>
