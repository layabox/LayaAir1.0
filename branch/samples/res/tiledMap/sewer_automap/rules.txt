# lines starting with # or // are comments

# Feel free to comment out certain rules, to see if and how they are working.
# So have fun experimenting with this bunch of rules :)

# First apply only one tile rules to fill the regions
#
# We mark the place, where rules are defined, with the RuleRegion layer.
# So whereever there are tiles at the ruleRegion layer, it will be used as a rule.
# In the RuleSet layer we can define, which combination of tiles must occur
# to trigger the specific rule.
# The layers Rule_Ground, Rule_Over and Rule_Over2 define the output of the rules.
#
# Which tiles should I use in the regions layer?
# Actually there can be any tiles, but it should be the same tiles for one rule.
# So use whatever you want, maybe a colorful tile so you can see easily that these
# tiles are used for defining the rule region.
#
# In the very first rulefile used for Automapping it might be useful to define
# some map properties:
# "DeleteTiles" = "true", "false" - This property determines if all tiles in the
#                                   whole region where Automapping takes place
#                                   are deleted.
#                                   That is useful, when not all layers are covered
#                                   at all places. (Check the Over and Over2 layer!)
# "AutoMappingRadius" = 0,1,2...  - This property determines which regions are
#                                   automatically remapped at live Automapping.
#                                   When you draw directly into the map,
#                                   not the whole map is remapped, but only a little
#                                   place around. Here you can specify how many
#                                   tiles at least should be remapped.

./rule_001.tmx




# Setup the right transition tiles at the border of light blue stone tiles
#
# Basically it is the same as the first rule, we are just using bigger rules.
# Whenever there is a light blue tile beside a grey tile, one of these rules
# will apply.

./rule_002.tmx




# Now put straight walls
#
# Note: Compare the regions and the set layer!
# Not at all places where a rule is defined, there is a tile in the input_set layer.
# This means that there can be any tiles except those used by the rule.
# So there are no black tiles allowed, when there are no tiles in the input_set
# layer.

./rule_003.tmx




# Now we add inner corners for walls
#
# (No new features introduced)

./rule_004.tmx




# Now we add the corners for walls
#
# (No new features introduced)

./rule_005.tmx




# Correct the error we got in the two previous rulefiles (overwrite it once more)
#
# Here we can see the use of input_set and input_NotSet
# With the input_NotSet we can define which tiles must not be used at certain places
# Important sideeffect: the empty regions in ruleSet can be anything now, including
# black tiles as used here!
#
# So when you use both input_Set and input_NotSet, you need to specify exactly what
# is allowed at which places.

./rule_006.tmx




# Setup the corner stones for light blue stone tiles
#
# Hey, there are multiple layers called input_NotSet!
# Yes, when you need to specify multiple allowed or disallowed tiles per
# position, you can use multiple layers of input_Set and input_NotSet

./rule_007.tmx





# Setup objects now
# The objects '1' will be placed. They will be placed based on the
# Over layer, which was created by previous rules.
# The placement of objects is done in south-east corners.

./rule_008.tmx




# Setup another object.
# This object is based on input from the Ground layer.
# It will put objects to borderstones which are near an end of that borderline.
#

./rule_009.tmx
